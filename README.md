## Starting a project
To start project go to GCP console
## Creating a virtual environment
First we have to install 'python3-venv' with the following command:
```
sudo apt install python3-env
```
Then we execute following command:
```
python3 -m venv venv
```
To activate virtual environment do:
```
venv/bin/activate.bat
```
In order to add new packages in our new virtual environment,
create a new file 'requirements.txt' and do:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
